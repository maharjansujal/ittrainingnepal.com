          <h2 className="block text-2xl font-bold">Rust Programming Course</h2>
          <p className="block my-3">Rust programming language primarily focuses on safety, productivity, and performance. It is a statically typed language which means that it improves memory safety and error detection, leading to more reliable builds. These aspects made it one of the most desired programming languages amongst developers.</p>
          <p className="block my-3">An employee of Mozilla Graydon Hoare created Rust in 2006 as a personal project. As of today&apos;s date, this programming language works as an alternative to C and C++. Programmers who often seek scalability and concurrency while coding use Rust. </p>
          <p className="block my-3">Rust programming is usually used while creating the game engine. Besides that, it can be used for applications that use virtual reality, web development, and machine learning. Rust serves as a coding language for the data science backend as well. </p>
          <p className="block my-3">Top companies like Facebook, Discord, Microsoft, Dropbox, e.t.c use Rust for various purposes. For example, Facebook has joined the Rust foundation to utilize it in every way possible for development, from source control to compilers.</p>
